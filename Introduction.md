👋 Hi, I’m @waterkenching

I'm studying hard with the goal of becoming an excellent technical artist✨

I plan to complete my first renderer there, on the basis of other's projects， hope you can help me a lot.

I have a lot to learn, mistakes are inevitable. Hope everything goes well.

Experienced senior guidance is welcome！✨
